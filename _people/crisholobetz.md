Compositional learning and inference is a core capability of intelligent agents. It allows agents to learn and perform complex tasks in a flexible way by combining lower level task and knowledge they already acquired. 
My aim is to formulate a compositional cognitive process in biological agent, emulate it in artificial neural networks to establish an analytical understanding of the learning process.   
To do this, I aim to study both computational/theoretical approach to describe a compositinal learning and experimental approach to figure out how biological agents represent and solve compositionality underlying tasks.
