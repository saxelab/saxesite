I am a second year student at Gatsby co-supervised by Andrew Saxe and Felix Hill. I'm interested in how humans and AIs can form abstract concepts and transfer them across tasks (incl. different state spaces). Currently, I study this through the lens of Sudoku-esque Nikoli puzzles, which offer a great test bed where concept learning is easily quantifiable and high-level concepts are known to apply across puzzles. I'm also generally interested in large language models, and their emergent abilities.

In my free time, I love to play strategy board games, listen to sci-fi/fantasy audiobooks, and vibe to (mostly Ed Sheeran) music.
