Before joining the lab as a DPhil student, I studied Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück and Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin. My research aims at developing mathematical tools and at using simulation studies to understand learning dynamics of gradient-based algorithms and how they apply to learning in biological neural networks.
