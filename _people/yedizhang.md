I am a PhD student at Gatsby co-advised by [Peter Latham](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~pel/) and Andrew Saxe.

I am interested in how neural networks with different architectures learn, including [fully-connected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12615), [multimodal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00935), and [attention-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16265) networks. Through theoretical approaches, I study how network architectures and data statistics shape the loss landscape and influence learning dynamics.
