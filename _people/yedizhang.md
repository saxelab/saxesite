I am a PhD student at the Gatsby Unit co-advised by [Peter Latham](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~pel/) and Andrew Saxe.

I use theoretical approaches to study how neural networks with [different architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20607) learn, including [fully-connected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12615), [attention-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16265), and [multimodal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00935) networks.
