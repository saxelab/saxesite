Learning over long timescales often involves developing increasingly effective strategies, mastering multiple tasks and combining information in new ways. In addition, we frequently learn in social settings where individuals can specialise differently and collectively solve complex problems. My research investigates such individual and collective long-term learning from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.

I am a Research Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (UCL) funded by the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) and Gatsby Charitable Foundation.
