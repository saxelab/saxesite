A core challenge in machine learning is understanding how neural networks construct internal representations of data structures. But what exactly constitutes data structure in this context? How can we develop simple yet insightful mathematical models to describe it? How does the learning algorithm encode these structures, and how does the amount of training data influence this process?
These questions are central to my research, which combines theoretical approaches — inspired by methods from statistical physics — with controlled numerical experiments. Currently, my work focuses on generative AI models, particularly diffusion models, and formal grammars from linguistics. By exploring these models, I aim to uncover the principles that govern how deep learning algorithms represent and generate structured data.
