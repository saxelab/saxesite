 Andrew Saxe is a Professor of Theoretical Neuroscience and Machine Learning at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit and Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL, and a Visiting Professor at Wits University. His research seeks to unravel the computational principles governing learning in artificial and biological systems. To do so, his work draws on a range of applied mathematics in order to understand modern ‘deep’ artificial neural networks and develop theories for experimental domains in neuroscience and psychology. His work has been recognized by the Robert J. Glushko Dissertation Prize from the Cognitive Science Society, Wellcome-Beit Prize, Schmidt Science Polymath award, and the Blavatnik UK Finalist Award in Life Sciences. He is a CIFAR Fellow in the Learning in Machines & Brains program.
