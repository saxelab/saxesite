Whether a novel task is worth learning, how effort may impact learning, and how much effort to allocate towards learning 
are important questions agents face. To answer these questions, I'm currently working in models of cognitive control for 
learning systems. Particularly how control signals might shape the learning dynamics in linear networks. I'm also 
collaborating with Clementine Domine (somewhere in this same page) to build a software for people to test their models 
on hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, on simulated environments that somehow resemble the experimental setting, 
to directly compare with neural data recorded from each experiment. I have a broad set of interests, 
such as neuroscience, machine learning, biology, and philosophy in science.
