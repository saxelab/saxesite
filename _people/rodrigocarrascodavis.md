Whether a novel task is worth learning, how effort may impact learning, and how much effort to allocate towards learning 
are important questions agents face. To answer these questions, I'm currently working in models of cognitive control for 
learning systems. Particularly how control signals might shape the learning dynamics in linear networks. I'm also collaborating with Clementine Domine (somewhere in this same 
page) to build a software for people to test their models on hippocampus and entorhinal cortex on simulated
environments that somehow resemble the experimental setting, to directly compare with neural data from the respective
experiments, the goal of this project is to standardize the way people develop theoretical models and compare with
experiment, and have a clear view of mechanistic understanding of these regions of the brain (and maybe others regions as well).
I have a broad set of interests, such as neuroscience, machine learning, biology, and philosophy in science.
