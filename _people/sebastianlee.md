I am interested in machine learning paradigms involving multiple tasks, such as continual learning (tasks in sequence) and meta-learning (task distributions). I want to develop a better understanding of phenomena in deep neural networks in these problem settings. I am jointly supervised by Claudia Clopath at Imperial College London. Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's in computer science with Andrew Saxe in Oxford.
