I am interested in how intelligent agents can make rich and structured inferences from impoverished data.
I demonstrate how such abilities can be implemented via learning algorithms in neural networks, with the aim of grounding higher-level cognitive phenomena in a candidate neural implementation.
This research requires me to use cross-disciplinary insights from psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning,
in addition to a combination of behavioral experiments, computational simulations, and analytical techniques.
