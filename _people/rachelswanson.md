A remarkable feature of the brain is its ability to transform experience into structured knowledge that enables open-ended learning - something current machine learning systems still struggle to achieve. Sleep plays a critical role in this process by adaptively reshaping neural representations, yet how the neural dynamics unique to sleep accomplish this remains poorly understood. My research aims to advance our understanding of sleep function through cross-disciplinary insights from neuroscience and machine learning, with a current focus on modeling systems consolidation between the hippocampus and neocortex at both mechanistic and normative levels of abstraction. This work is motivated by a broader interest in "localâ€“global scaling problems".
