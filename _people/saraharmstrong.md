I'm a student on the 1+3 doctoral programme in neuroscience, co-supervised by Andrew Saxe and Adam Packer. My  project involves devising and testing experimental predictions about network dynamics across the visual cortical hierarchy under different theories, in response to activity perturbations, during sensory experience and throughout the course of perceptual learning. Previously, I studied neuroscience at Bristol University and spent time in industry at Roche, where I studied the development of excitatory-inhibitory balance in human stem cell derived neurons.
