Deep neural networks and the brain are capable of learning to solve complex problems from examples. Learning theory seeks to explain this
by mathematically solving the equations of learning, but such solutions only exist for simplified systems unlike those in reality.
These equations are also hard to interpret, as they refer to model parameters rather than learned concepts.

My research aims to identify key concepts and intuitions that offer simple explanations for how these systems learn. I use approximations, modeling, and physics-inspired reasoning to study the learning dynamics of representational structures and explain generalization. Though inexact, this approach is more interpretable and can generate hypotheses testable in more complex settings.
